I represent a note at a low level of interaction with the external C library PortMidiLibrary.

- noteName : symbol representing the note name (ex : #( 'C' ))
- noteValue : hexadecimal value of the note (ex : C = 60 = 16r3C)

All class side methods create a new instance of me for each note of the medium octave.
